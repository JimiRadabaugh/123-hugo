A dragon is a legendary creature, typically scaled or fire spewing and with serpentine, reptilian or avian traits, that features in the myths of many cultures around world. The two most well known cultural traditions of dragon are:

* The European dragon, derived from European folk traditions and ultimately related to Balkans and Western Asian mythologies. Most are depicted as reptilian creatures with animal level intelligence, and are uniquely six limbed.
* The Chinese dragon, with counterparts in Japan, Korea and other East Asian and South Asian countries. Most are depicted as serpentine creatures with above average intelligence.
